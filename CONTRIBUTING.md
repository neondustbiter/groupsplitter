## How to Contribute

### Pull Requests
1. Fork the repo and create a new branch.
git checkout -b feature/some-change
2. Make your changes in `index.html` (all logic lives there).

git push origin feature/some-change
5. Open a pull request on GitHub.

## Guidelines
- Keep dependencies minimal (currently only Tailwind via CDN).
- Avoid frameworks. Vanilla JS only.
- Code should remain self-contained (single HTML file).
- Use consistent naming and formatting (camelCase for JS, Tailwind for styling).
- Keep UI changes subtle and functional.
